This project provides a simple web form to help users generate a Subject Access Request (SAR) email to the General Medical Council (GMC) concerning the public consultation on the regulation of Physician Associates (PAs) and Anaesthesia Associates (AAs).

## Overview

The General Medical Council (GMC) has been at the center of controversy for not releasing raw data from its public consultation on the regulation of Physician Associates (PAs) and Anaesthesia Associates (AAs).
